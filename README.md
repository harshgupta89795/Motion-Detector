A real-time motion detection system built using OpenCV and Python that captures images when motion is detected and automatically sends email alerts with the detected activity. It also includes a storage cleanup mechanism for efficient memory management.

📌 Features
✔️ Real-time motion detection using OpenCV
✔️ Automatic image capture when motion is detected
✔️ Email notifications with captured images
✔️ Multithreading for smooth performance
✔️ Automatic folder cleanup to manage storage efficiently
✔️ Customizable sensitivity threshold for motion detection
